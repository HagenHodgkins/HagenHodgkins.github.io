          <p><strong>Abstract</strong><br />
            The Center of Excellence in Remote Sensing Education and  Research  (CERSER) has implemented three research projects during the summer   Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) program gathering water  quality  data for local waterways. The data has been compiled manually  utilizing pen and  paper and then entered into a spreadsheet. With the  spread of electronic  devices capable of interacting with databases, the  development of an electronic  method of entering and manipulating the  water quality data was pursued during  this project.</p>
          <p>This project focused on the development of an  interactive  database to gather, display, and analyze data collected  from local waterways.  The database and entry form was built in MySQL on  a PHP server allowing  participants to enter data from anywhere  Internet access is available. This  project then researched applying  this data to the Google Maps site to provide  labeling and information  to users. The NIA server at http://nia.ecsu.edu is  used to host the  application for download and for storage of the databases.</p>
          <p>This project was built on water quality data gathered by the Summer   Research Experience for Undergraduate teams during the summers of 2014,  2013,  and 2011.</p></td>

        ECSU / 2016

          <p><strong>Abstract</strong><br />
            The Sargasso Sea has been a ocean life habitat for millions of years, yet accurate assessment of the boundary area and detection of these relatively small sea surface features using Landsat series and Moderate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) instruments have been found to have difficulty or even impossible due to lack of spatial resolution, coverage, recurring observance,and algorithm limitations to Identify pelagic species of Sargassum. Sargassum rafts tend to be elongated, curved in the upwind direction and warmer than the surrounding ocean surface. Long weed 'trails' extending upwind from the rafts are evidence of plants dropping out and being left behind. Satellite data Utilizing a simple ocean color indexes such as the floating algae Index and Normalized Differential Vegetation Index (NDVI) have been established to detect floating algae in open environments using MODIS instruments. Floating Algae Index (FAI) has shown advantages over the traditional NDVI and Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) because FAI is less sensitive to changes in environmental and observing conditions (aerosol type and thickness, solar/viewing geometry, and sun glint) and can see through thin clouds. The baseline subtraction method provides a simple yet effective means for atmospheric correction. The algorithms assisted in identifying the boundary area of the Sargasso sea and the path of this floating algae past cape hatteras into the Atlantic ocean. Due to the fact that similar spectral bands are available on many existing and planned satellite sensors such as Landsat series observations satellites, the NDVI and FIA concept was extendable to establish a long-term record of these ecologically biological dependent ocean plants.</p></td>

        IU / 2016
        </p>
          <p><strong>Abstract</strong><br />
            When developers need to set up a new machine with the intent to use it as a development environment they must go through the hassle to create a list of what they need. They must then proceed to individually download each of the programs and dependencies that they would require for their machine to be viable for the development of projects. The creation of an automated system for downloading a pre existing list of programs and dependencies would allow a developer to skip this step entirely and relatively quickly delve into their development tasks. With this in mind we applied DevOps concepts and worked with ansible to create a role that did just this. We then applied the benefits of ansible role automation to a big data project which had several roles built into it that otherwise should be absent from the project's repository.  As such we created individual repositories to host the roles and created an ansible document within the project that would call these roles should they be needed.</p></td>

        ECSU / 2017

          <p><a href="http://nia.ecsu.edu/ur/1617/teams/terascan/">http://nia.ecsu.edu/ur/1617/teams/terascan/</a></p>
          <p><strong>Abstract</strong><br />
            According to the State Climate Office of North Carolina, since 2007 the northern coastal plain of North Carolina has been experiencing a long-term summer drought. The team’s objective was to analyze how long-term drought in summer months’ affected vegetation and land surface temperature in the Pasquotank, Perquimans, Camden and Gates county areas. The team collected imagery data through the SeaSpace TeraScan system in order to produce land surface temperature (LST) and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) products. The data products were averaged into monthly and yearly composites so that the team could use TeraVision to depict the differences of values for the products. </p></td>
